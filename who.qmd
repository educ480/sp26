Ralph Johnson Bunche was born on August 7, 1904 in Detroit, Michigan. He became a pioneering diplomat, academic, and civil rights activist. In 1928, Bunche joined the faculty of Howard University, where he founded the Political Science Department. He was the first African American to earn a Ph.D. in political science from Harvard University in 1934.

The [Ralph J. Bunch International Affairs Center](https://global.howard.edu/ralph-j-bunche/), Directed by [Dr. Tonija Hope](https://profiles.howard.edu/tonija-navas), is located here at Howard!

His groundbreaking diplomatic work transformed international relations. In 1946, he joined the United Nations as director of the Trusteeship Division and in 1949 successfully negotiated armistice agreements between Israel and four Arab states, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950, becoming the first African American and person of color to receive this honor. Bunche's influence extended to the civil rights movement, participating in key events like the 1963 March on Washington and the 1965 Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights March alongside Martin Luther King Jr.

![Mary McCleod Bethune](img/mary-mcleod-bethune-2.jpg){width="30%"}

Mary McLeod Bethune was born on July 10, 1875 in Mayesville, South Carolina. She was the first of her 17 siblings to be born free from slavery. She became a pioneering educator, civil rights activist, and a women's rights advocate. In 1904, Bethune founded the Daytona Normal and Industrial Training Institute for Negro Girls with just \$1.50, which later merged with Cookman Institute to become Bethune-Cookman College, now a university. She also established the first hospital for Black people in Daytona Beach, Florida, in 1911.

Bethune's work had a significant impact on international affairs and education.

She was the only woman of color at the founding conference of the United Nations in 1945, where she served as an associate consultant to the US delegation in drafting the UN charter. Her focus during these negotiations was on the rights of people living in colonized countries worldwide. Bethune's Pan-African activism extended her influence throughout the African diaspora, as she worked to create solidarity among Africans globally through her writings and travels.
